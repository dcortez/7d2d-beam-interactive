#List of Things to do:

- [ ] Implement GUI
  * (tkinter) for entering credentials and starting the interactive app.

- [ ] Implement DB
  * (SQLLITE) to save GUI entries and items, enemies, animals...

- [x] ~~Change command from say to sayplayer for certain buttons.~~
   * ~~Reasoning being you don't want others around you to know you are getting a sniper rifle and to clean up clutter.~~

- [x] ~~Have this not just use beam sparks, intergrate with different bots to their currency~~
 * ~~Possibly remove beam buttons all together and use just chat commands.~~
