#List of Things to do:

1. Implement GUI
  * (tkinter) for entering credentials and starting the interactive app.

2. Implement DB
  * (SQLLITE) to save GUI entries and items, enemies, animals...

3. Change command from say to sayplayer for certain buttons.
   * Reasoning being you don't want others around you to know you are getting a sniper rifle and to clean up clutter.

4. Have this not just use beam sparks, intergrate with different bots to their currency
 * Possibly remove beam buttons all together and use just chat commands.
