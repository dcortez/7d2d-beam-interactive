Beam Interactive controls for 7 Days to Die

# CAVEATS
  NOTE: THIS ONLY WORKS ON A DEDICATED SERVER WITH TELNET RUNNING!

This will be a working repo for our Interactive controls for a 7 Days to Die server.

Basic design is as follows:
  - Viewer presses a button while viewing your stream to perform an action
    -- Actions include: spawn airdrop, debuffplayer, givequest, and more
  - 7d2d.js receives input and passes appropriate action to telnet.py (Python telnet script)
  - telnet.py connects to 7DaysToDie_Dedicated_Server telnet and sends command based on action passed.
